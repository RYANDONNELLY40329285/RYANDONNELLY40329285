👋 Hi, I'm Ryan — a Software Engineering graduate from QUB.

I build end-to-end systems focusing on performance, clean architecture,
and real-world integration (C++, Rust, Node.js, Electron, Spring Boot).

🔧 Featured Projects
• High-performance C++ fuzzy matcher (algorithms + benchmarking)
• Rust thread-safe task queue with concurrency benchmarks
• Electron + React desktop app integrating Twitch + X APIs
• Microservice-based ticketing system with Docker & auth

💼 Currently seeking a Graduate / Junior Software Engineer role (UK)
